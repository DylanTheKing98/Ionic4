               <li>Sign-up for products and services is subject to the cooling-off period described in section 44 of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act ("the ECT Act").</li>
               <li>saYellow provides Services on the basis of information provided by the Client, and saYellow offers no warranty as to the suitability of the Services beyond the requirements as expressed by the Client.</li>
               <li>saYellow reserves the right to stop offering particular Services if it deems it necessary. saYellow will then either provide the service for the remainder of the time that has been paid for or refund the amount paid for that specific service.</li>
            </ol>

               <li>Should a referred client decide to cancel its services within three months of signup, saYellow reserves the right to reverse both the referrer and the referee's credits.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><a name="Clause 10"></a>10. Payment and Penalties</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>saYellow only accepts Debit Order and Credit Card payments for month to month services, and will only accept alternative payment under specific circumstances and only by prior arrangement at saYellow's discretion. </li>
               <li>The Client's monthly debit orders of the Fee will be submitted monthly in advance on or about five days prior to the selected payment date. This will apply to both Debit Order Payments and Credit Card Payments. </li>
               <li>saYellow will not accept any liability or responsibility for delays, suspensions or impact to Services due to use of non-approved payment methods by Clients. </li>
               <li>Unpaid Debit Orders, declined Credit Cards or any other irregularity regarding payment which results in non-payment may result in immediate suspension of Services (which may not be limited to the particular Service in question). saYellow retains the right to suspend any Services for non-payment, and to withhold such Services until all arrears are settled in full on any and all products and Services. </li>
               <li>saYellow reserves its rights to change its prices at any time on reasonable notice, which will not be less than 30 days, as per the minimum term of a month to month agreement. </li>
               <li>saYellow may charge an Admin Fee for failed or returned payments, regardless of method of payment or the reason for non-payment. Such Admin Fees are payable immediately and in conjunction with the outstanding fees which resulted in non-payment. Admin Fees will be calculated on a sliding scale based on the number of incidents of non-payment on the Client's payment record. Non-payment of Admin Fees will be considered non-payment and will be subject to the same terms. Once levied, Admin Fees are not recoverable or reversible, regardless of whether payment is made within the prescribed period. </li>
               <li>If the Client's Services are suspended or terminated for any reason, including non-payment, saYellow may charge a Reconnection Fee for subsequent reactivation of services. Reconnection Fees are payable in full before any services can be reactivated, once suspended. saYellow may charge multiple reconnections Fees where multiple products are affected, and may charge "escalating" penalties for repeated non-payment offences. Any prior leniency shown in this regard will not prejudice saYellow's right to enforce such penalties in full at any time (within their discretion). </li>
               <li>Reconnection of Services may be subject to a waiting period of up to 72 hours, at saYellow's discretion, regardless of when payment is received or cleared. Reconnection is subject to a reconnection fee as described in ClientZone. </li>
               <li>In cases of suspension of Services due to non-payment, saYellow reserves the right to levy both Reconnection Fees and Admin Fees. Any and all penalty fees must be settled in full, prior to reconnection of affected services. </li>
               <li>Both Admin and Reconnection fees will not exceed R400 (charged on a sliding scale based on the number of incidents of non-payment), and this amount is based on (but not limited to) a reasonable estimation of accumulated administrative costs (such as labour), bank penalties and resubmission charges levied by payment carriers. </li>
               <li>In the case of billing disputes, the onus is upon the Client to raise such disputes in good time to prevent interruption of services while the billing is in dispute. Reparations will be made to Clients with successful disputes by means of an account credit or refund, at saYellow's discretion. </li>
               <li>saYellow reserves the right to terminate services where a Client has shown a repeated disregard for payment terms and consistently fails to make regular scheduled payments on time and using approved payment methods. The conditions of termination will be based on guidelines determined at saYellow's discretion and may vary. The means and terms of termination will be determined at saYellow's discretion. Notice of termination will be provided to the best of saYellow's ability, but saYellow will not be held liable for claims or requests for further provision of services once a Client's services have been terminated due to non-payment. </li>
               <li>Unless otherwise agreed:<ol>
                     <li>Billing will commence on the date that Service provision commences. Partial months will be charged pro rata. </li>
                     <li>Services are billed in advance and all invoices must be paid by the Client in advance. </li>
                     <li>Any Services invoiced in arrears are payable on presentation of invoice. </li>
                     <li>All Fees and other amounts payable are quoted exclusive of VAT.</li>
                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li>Interest will be charged on any amount that remains unpaid by the Client beyond the due date of payment:<ol>
                     <li>The interest rate will be 2% (two percent) above the prime overdraft rate (percent, per annum), up to a maximum of 2% per month. </li>
                     <li>The prime overdraft rate will be as charged by saYellow's bankers at the time, which will be evidenced by a certificate issued by any manager of that bank, whose authority it shall not be necessary to prove. </li>
                     <li>The interest will be calculated from the due date of payment to the date of actual payment, both days inclusive, and will be compounded monthly in arrears. The Client agrees and undertakes to pay the interest.</li>
                  </ol>

            <p><strong><a name="Clause 11"></a>11. Debit Order Authorisation</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>By accepting these terms, the Client hereby authorizes saYellow to debit their nominated bank account or credit card any variable amount pertaining to the service or products they have selected, on sign up for a calculated pro-rata and thereafter on the selected day of each month (or on signup entirely for purchase of non-service products). This sum being the amount for settlement of the monthly amount due by the Client in respect of services or products. </li>
               <li>The Client authorises saYellow's nominated agent to debit their bank account or credit card on saYellow's behalf (the "authorized party"). The debit authority will remain in force until such services or products are cancelled, subject to the condition that Client agrees that debits related to cancellation notice periods will be honored before the expiration of the debit authority. </li>
               <li>The Client agrees that the authorized party may freely cede, delegate or assign any of its rights or obligations in terms of this debit order instruction without consent from the Client and that the Client may not cede, delegate or assign any of their rights and obligations in terms of this debit order instruction to any third party without the prior written consent of the authorized party.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><a name="Clause 12"></a>12. Term and Termination</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>saYellow operates Month-to-Month contracts. Either the Client or saYellow may terminate the agreement, or a particular Service, by giving one calendar month's notice to the other. For example if notice is given on the 15th of January, termination will take effect on the 1st of March. Particular Service Terms may allow for shorter notice periods. </li>
               <li>The Client must give notice of termination to saYellow via ClientZone. Cancellation of any Service is the Client's responsibility and all tools to effect such cancellation are provided in ClientZone. The Client is responsible for ensuring that such cancellation of service is actioned with due attention to terms of cancellation, as well as cancellation conditions which require the Client to specifically indicate a required process. Should the Client incorrectly complete the cancellation process, saYellow will not be liable for any additional costs or compensation due to the error. </li>
               <li>Either party may terminate this Agreement and any service provision where there is a breach of this Agreement by the other which has not been remedied within seven (7) days of receipt of written notice to do so. </li>
               <li>The Client acknowledges that saYellow may terminate this Agreement by written notice, including email, and without liability in the event of the termination of its agreement with an upstream licensee relevant to the provision of any connectivity Service. </li>
               <li>saYellow reserves the right to deactivate or terminate selected Free Products, should they not be used within a prescribed period or at saYellow's sole discretion. Such termination will take place automatically, as per product specifications, and may occur without prior warning. saYellow accepts no liability should such termination take place, and not warranty is made regarding the availability of said products in the future. For example, should a Fax2Email be deleted if not used within 90 days, saYellow makes no warranty that the number can be made available again, and accepts no liability for any consequences resulting in the deletion of the product. saYellow reserves the right to terminate products provided as Free products where a breach has occurred (such as non-payment) in relation to other products, whether or not such breach has direct or indirect bearing on the Free product service provision.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><a name="Clause 13"></a>13. Transferability</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>Should saYellow agree to the acquisition or transfer of any or all of it's services to another company, such services and services agreements will be transferred to the acquiring entity. Clients affected will be notified of such changes and any potential impact to their service agreement within the minimum term (30 days) of a month to month agreement.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><a name="Clause 14"></a>14. Client Information and Privacy</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>Clients signing up for services as a Primary Contact are considered as "the client" and no other parties will be permitted access or authority to the Client Account, even if they are a 3rd party recipient or affiliate of the "client". </li>
               <li>saYellow will observe all privacy of information best practices, in accordance with the applicable laws of South Africa, including the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPI) of 2013. </li>
               <li>The Client consents to saYellow processing Personal Information transmitted to the saYellow System in a way which is consistent with the Service being provided. Where the Client's use of a Service leads to the transmission of Personal Information to or from the Republic of South Africa, the Client acknowledges that it has a duty to comply with any relevant statutory provisions dealing with data privacy either in the Republic of South Africa or in any foreign country to which the Personal Information is transmitted. The Client warrants that it has obtained the consent of any third party for the use of that party's Personal Information in this way, or otherwise that such processing is lawful, and indemnifies saYellow from any claim brought by such third party as a result of its failure to do so. </li>
               <li>saYellow may retain backups as a matter of course for up to five years after termination, and the Client consents to such retention. However saYellow gives no warranty in respect of the effectiveness of such backups (if any).</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><a name="Clause 15"></a>15. Security</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>saYellow will implement measures in line with Good Industry Practice to ensure the security of the saYellow System and the physical security of saYellow's premises, but gives no warranty that breaches of security will not take place.</li>
               <li>If the Client discovers a security violation, or thinks that a security violation is imminent, it must immediately notify saYellow in an appropriate way that does not further compromise security concerns.</li>
               <li>If the Client suffers damage as a result of loss or corruption of Client Data through a security violation, it will be liable for the damage if the violation was the Client's fault.</li>
               <li>The Client must not do anything that may prejudice the security of the saYellow System, and must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that: <ol>
                     <li>no unlawful access is gained to saYellow's premises, the saYellow System, or the Client's own system; </li>
                     <li>no Malicious Code is introduced into the saYellow System; and </li>
                     <li>the Client Data is safeguarded. </li>
                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li>If a security violation occurs, or saYellow is of the view that a security violation is imminent, saYellow may take whatever steps it considers necessary to maintain the proper functioning of the saYellow System including without limitation: <ol>
                     <li>changing the Client's access codes and passwords (or those of any user of the saYellow System), and </li>
                     <li>preventing access to the saYellow System. </li>
                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li>saYellow takes reasonable measures to provide disaster recovery but does not warrant that recovery will be successful or that it will be completed within any time limit. </li>
               <li>The Client must give its full cooperation to saYellow in any investigation that may be carried out by saYellow regarding a security violation. </li>
               <li>If the Client is providing any service to third parties that makes use of the saYellow System, the Client must contractually bind those third parties to equivalent terms regarding security as are set out in this clause 15. </li>
               <li>saYellow may on prior written notice to the Client inspect the Client's installation and Client Equipment located on saYellow's premises to ensure compliance with the building regulations and restrictions agreed between the parties.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><a name="Clause 16"></a>16. Suspension or Terminations of Service</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>saYellow may, subject to this Agreement or Terms of Use Policy, suspend or terminate services of a Client in its absolute discretion by providing email notice if: <ol>
                     <li>the Client commits a serious or repeated breach of the Agreement or the Client engages in any conduct which in saYellow's opinion would have a negative impact on saYellow, other clients or saYellow's staff or is detrimental to the welfare, good order or character of saYellow; or </li>
                     <li>Any part of the Client's Fees are not paid in full when due; or </li>
                     <li>The information the Client supplied to saYellow is found to be incorrect or false; </li>
                     <li>saYellow reasonably thinks that the Client's use of the Services may result in the commission of a crime or is otherwise unlawful. </li>
                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li>saYellow reserves the right to effect such suspension or termination without notice, depending on the severity of the breach, but will undertake to inform Clients where possible. Upon such suspension or termination, such Clients: <ol>
                     <li>Will not be eligible for reimbursement / compensation, unless at saYellow's discretion </li>
                     <li>Will not be eligible for payment under any Guarantee or similar promotion </li>

                  </ol>
               </li>
               <li>The period of suspension will be that which is reasonable under the particular circumstances that gave rise to the suspension.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><a name="Clause 17"></a>17. Limitation of Liability and Indemnity</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li>SAYELLOW WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO THE CLIENT OR ANY THIRD PARTY IN RESPECT OF ANY AND ALL DAMAGES, LOSS, CLAIMS OR COSTS, OF WHATEVER NATURE AND INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES, SUFFERED BY THE CLIENT OR THIRD PARTY, HOWSOEVER ARISING, AND SAYELLOW WILL MOREOVER NOT BE LIABLE WHETHER THE LOSS WAS THE RESULT OF THE ACT OR OMISSION OF AN SAYELLOW EMPLOYEE, VICARIOUS OR STRICT LIABILITY.</li>
               <li>In the event that saYellow is nonetheless held liable, the quantum of saYellow's liability will not exceed the monthly or pro-rata fees due for the Service that occasioned the loss, in the preceding three (3) months, regardless of whether the claim arises out of negligence on the part of saYellow or any other cause. </li>
               <li>USE OF THE SERVICES INDICATES THAT THE CLIENT INDEMNIFIES AND HOLDS HARMLESS SAYELLOW IN RESPECT OF ANY DAMAGES, LOSS OR COSTS OR CLAIMS INSTITUTED AGAINST SAYELLOW ARISING FROM ANY APPLICATION OR SUBSCRIPTION TO OR USE OF ANY SERVICE OR BREACH OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO IT. </li>
               <li>These limitations on liability and indemnities apply to the benefit of saYellow and saYellow's Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents and other representatives, as well as any third parties whose networks are connected to the saYellow System. </li>

               <li>If the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 is applicable to this Agreement, and any provision of this clause 17 is found by a court or tribunal with jurisdiction over saYellow to be unfair, unreasonable or unjust, then that provision (whether it be a word, phrase or sub-clause) will be severed, and the remainder of this clause 17 will have full force and effect. </li>
               <li>In the case of ambiguity, this clause 17 will take precedence over any expression of the Parties' intention, whether express or implied, that may be contained elsewhere in this Agreement.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong><a name="Clause 18"></a>18. Notices</strong></p>

               <li>All requests by the Client for the provisioning, modification or termination of Services, and for modification of contact and other personal information must be made via ClientZone and saYellow reserves the right to ignore any such request made in any other manner. </li>

                           <li>any notice that saYellow sends by email to an email account hosted on the saYellow System by the Client will be deemed to have been received by the Client on the date of transmission; and </li>
                           <li>if a written notice or communication is actually received by one of the Parties from the other, this will be adequate written notice or communication to that Party.</li>
                        </ol>
                     </li>

            </ol>
            <p><strong><a name="Clause 19"></a>19. Interpretation and General</strong></p>
            <ol>
               <li><strong>Whole Agreement.</strong> This Agreement is the whole of the agreement between the parties, and no document or statement not mentioned above will form part of it. Only a written variation, waiver or cancellation agreed to by both parties will be of any effect. </li>
               <li><strong>Applicable Law and Jurisdiction</strong>. The law of the Republic of South Africa will apply to this Agreement, its interpretation and any matter or litigation relating to or arising from it, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of the Western Cape Division of the High Court in this regard.</li>
               <li><strong>Survival</strong>. For the avoidance of doubt, any provision of this Agreement that anticipates any right or duty extending beyond the termination or expiry of this Agreement will survive the termination or expiry of this Agreement and continue in full force and effect.</li>
               <li><strong>No Indulgence</strong>. If one party chooses not to enforce any part of this Agreement, that does not mean that the party cannot enforce that part at a later time. If any part of the Agreement is found to be unenforceable, the rest will still be enforceable.</li>
               <li><strong>Representatives</strong>. The signatories hereto acting in representative capacities warrant that they are authorised to act in such capacities, and accept personal liability under this Agreement should they prove not to be so authorised.</li>
               <li><strong>Reading Down</strong>. If a provision of this Agreement is reasonably capable of an interpretation which would make that provision valid and enforceable and an alternative interpretation that would make it void, illegal, invalid or otherwise unenforceable, then that provision shall be interpreted, so far as is possible, to be limited and read down to the extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable.</li>
               <li><strong>Severance</strong>. In the event that any part of this Agreement is found to be partially or fully unenforceable because it does not comply with any law, or for any other reason, this will not affect the application or enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement.</li>
